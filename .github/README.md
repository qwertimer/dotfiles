# My dotfiles

This is a repository to store my dotfiles using git bare as my setup. I like the simplicity of git bare and will seperate out my other configurations into their own repo.


TODO:
I plan on creating a couple of bootstrapping functions for setting up submodules such as my ansible scripts and my scripts folder on my system as well as some configurations that i use often.
